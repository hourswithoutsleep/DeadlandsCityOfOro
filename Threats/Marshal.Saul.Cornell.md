## Marshal Saul Cornell

**Marshal Saul Cornell** is the town marshal, a distinguished older man who tries to talk those law-breakers down first, but in doing so generally provokes a killing rage in one of the others listening near by. He is in fact an abomination Agent Provocateur (The Last Sons pg. 285). The following things are likely to happen when he is involved:

* Order underlings to do terrible acts.
* Escape, no matter how well contained he is.
* Boast and gloat, maybe revealing a secret.
* Use an unnatural power.
