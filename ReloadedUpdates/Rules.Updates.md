## Rules Updates

The following are the ways that I am going to update the Reloaded rules to the new Savage Worlds Adventure Edition until we get a new version of the Deadlands rules for this edition. This will be a living document and as situations come up, I will make updates to it to reflect how things have changed.

### Secondary Attributes

**Grit** We will be using the Grit attribute which starts at 1 for Novice characters and increases by 1 for each Rank you achieve (Seasoned, Veteran, Heroic, Legendary)

### Skill Changes

**Riding** is added to the list of default skills for these sessions.

**Guts** we will not be using the Guts skill for fear checks, instead we will be using **Spirit** checks with a bonus from **Grit**

### Arcane Backgrounds

**Hucksters** will regain 5 power points every 3 hours, and have the ability to "Deal with the Devil" for more power points.
