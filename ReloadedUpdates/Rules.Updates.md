## Rules Updates

The following are the ways that I am going to update the Reloaded rules to the new Savage Worlds Adventure Edition until we get a new version of the Deadlands rules for this edition. This will be a living document and as situations come up, I will make updates to it to reflect how things have changed.

### Setting Rules

**Wound Cap** Because I am particularly lucky as a GM and I don't want to kill characters due to chance, I am using this setting rule.

### Secondary Attributes

**Grit** We will be using the Grit attribute which starts at 1 for Novice characters and increases by 1 for each Rank you achieve (Seasoned, Veteran, Heroic, Legendary)

### Skill Changes

**Riding** is added to the list of default skills for these sessions.

**Guts** we will not be using the Guts skill for fear checks, instead we will be using **Spirit** checks with a bonus from **Grit**

### Arcane Backgrounds

**Hucksters** will regain 5 power points every 3 hours, and have the ability to "Deal with the Devil" for more power points.

### Edges

**Veteran o' the Weird West**
Requirements: Wild Card, Novice, Occult d6+

**Texas Ranger** 
Requirements: Novice, Vigor d8+, Fighting d6+, Riding d6+, Shooting d6+, Survival d6+, Streetwise

### Rulings

**Dismounting**
Dismounting from a horse, wagon or other vehicle is a free action similar to dropping prone to the ground.

**Mounting**
Mounting a horse, wagon, or other vehicle (except a train at a train station) costs 2 inches of movement.
