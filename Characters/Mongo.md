### Starting Notes

You inherited a mining claim in the region around Oro City from your uncle Jeb. You must arrive within the month to claim your inheritance.

### Connections

Got Duane McAtavey to read the note informing him of his inheritance.

### Question

Who do you trust least Dolly, Duane, Fillmore, or Yiska and why?

### Learned

1. The miners do not trust the Guggenheim company because they do not hire miners. They only seem to hire laborers and mad scientists. They use infernal devices to pull ore out of their mines, not honest hard work.

2. You are invited to diner at the private residence of Mr. Meyer Guggenheim.
