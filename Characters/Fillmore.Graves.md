### Starting Notes

Oro City has urgent need for a new minister to lead a growing congregation. If interested please write to Augusta Tabor about the position. As a sign of our interest in this position being filled, we have recently built a new building to serve as our new church.

The last minister in the town disappeared during the night shortly after his new church was built, leaving the town looking for a new minister unexpectedly.
